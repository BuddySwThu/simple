			<h2>hr</h2>
			<p>
				The &lthr> element used to stand for "horizontal line" and that is still how it í typically displayed by browsers. However, in HTML5 the tag took on a semantic meaning, "semantic break". I will be using it often to break up exemple files when I wan to display multiple tags in one file.

		<section title="address">
			<h2>address</h2>
			<p>
				The &ltaddress> element indicates that the text is an address specific to the page, perhaps contact information for the author.

		<section title="blockquote">
			<h2>blockquote</h2>
			<p>
				The &ltblockquote> element is used fo extended quotations. It should include the cite attribute
				in order to show or link to the source of the quot.

		<section title="details">
			<h2>details</h2>
			<p>
				The &ltdetails> element is used in conjunction with the &ltsummary> tag. It is one of the tags that was created in response to the repeated use of scripting to open and clode content. It is not supported by all of the browsers yet through.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary>The Summary</summary>
				The rest of details content goes here. If only &ltdetails> element is not supported, then the summary and the content are always visible.
