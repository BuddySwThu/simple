			<h2>Anchor Links</h2>
			<p>
				The &lt;a> tag stands for anchor link<br>
				Needs a hyper-reference AND content!<br>
				href: reference to location of new content!<br>
				content: the “clickable” part (text or image)<br>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="Absolute">	
			<h2>Absolute Reference</h2>
			<p>
				With an absolute reference in the a href section we need to put a fully formed url. You need to have the http or https the address and any type of extra document name you want. So if you remember there's three parts to URL, you have the protocol, the host and the document. You need to include all of those if you have an absolute reference, right? Everything else is still pretty much the same.

			</ol>
		</div>

		<div id="Relative">
			<h2>Relative Reference</h2>
			<p>
				For a relative reference, we slightly change what goes in to the href. Instead of linking to some outside or even internal webpage, we're only going to put, in this case, the file name. So in this case we're going to link to page2.html. You might get slightly more in-depth than that, where you can include also some sort of folder name. So in this case we'd be going to the file called page2.html but it's in a different folder called docs the third way we can use a relative reference is to what we call use the ID tag. So when you have href equals hash pound or history, we're saying there's another location inside the same file and it's called history.

			<h2>Image as Links</h2>
			<p>
				All right? One of the other things that you can do is you can use images as the link. So the clickable component doesn't have to be text. You've seen this a lot. It can be icons, images. different things along that line. In this case, I went in and I use the regular H reference and what we're changing now, is not the h reference, but content that goes between the opening and closing tag. and I have gone ahead and I've put in an image instead. Make sure that you use the alt text to go along with that image. And another case I've done something very similar, the only difference is, instead of using a local reference right here for the image, I've used an absolute reference. I've put in the entire URL.<br>

			<h2>Embedded Links Section</h2>
			<p>
				With embedded links, I can click on any of these and navigate within the same page. So I'm not gonna go to a different page. I'm not gonna open up a new tab. Instead I'm gonna jump to different places within the page. So I went to absolute. I went to relative now if I try to do embedded references it doesn't look like it moved but it really did. It's just that we're already there. All right, so that is how these kind of embedded or internal links work, right? Now if at any time you get confused about how code is working. I just want to remind you they can always go to view.

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#Absolute">Absolute Reference.</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Relative">Relative Reference.</a></li>
				<li><a href="#images">Image Links.</a></li>		
			</ul>
			<p>
				When you click on any of the above links, the browser will bring that section into focus. It may be the case that the bottom two links don't do anything for you. That is because this content is already in your screen
